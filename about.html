                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I'm Nimay, a realistic photographer based in India. My journey began way back in 2022 with a simple mobile camera and a passion for capturing moments that often go unnoticed.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years, I've honed my skills and developed a unique style that blends natural light with candid expressions. What sets my work apart is the authentic approach to mobile photographyâ€”proving that compelling images come from vision and technique, not just expensive equipment.</p>
                    
                    <p>I create images that honor subtletyâ€”gentle light, honest expression, and the delicate tension between motion and stillness. Every frame is a conversation between subject and space, capturing the essence of the moment rather than staging it.</p>
                    
                    <h2>My Approach</h2>
                    <p>When I'm not behind the lens, you can find me exploring new places or experimenting with new techniques. The catch is that all my photos uploaded here are taken from a good mobile phone onlyâ€”a testament to the idea that great photography is about seeing, not just having the best gear.</p>
                    
                    <p>My work spans personal essays and commissioned projects, always maintaining the same philosophy: authentic moments deserve authentic capture. I believe in working with natural light whenever possible and letting subjects express themselves naturally.</p>
